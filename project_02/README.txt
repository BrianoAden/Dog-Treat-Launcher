<h1> Dog Treat Launcher PCB </h1>

<p>
You want to manufacture this PCB??? Wow you must really love your dog! Or you're just curious and wanted to read this file. Well, in the folder that you found this README inside, "project_02", there are three folders. Inside docs are just some screenshots of different parts of the board. Inside EAGLE, you will find the library I used to create the board, as well as the board's schematic and brd file. Inside MFG are the gerber files that you can use if you feel like spending a pretty penny on manufacturing this board.

This board is designed after the Dog Treat Launcher I designed and developed in project_01. If you care to learn more about that project, please read the README file in project_01. Following is the link to the hackster page I put up for the project. <a href="https://www.hackster.io/aden-briano/edes301-dog-treat-launcher-bcfb15">Dog Treat Launcher</a> Enjoy!
